INSTALLATION

To install TomatoCart open a browser and go to the URL where you put the TomatoCart files and follow instructions. 

TomatoCart has a built-in automatic installation system. However to use this you must first unpack the code to a web server.

The web server can either be on your local computer or on an internet host.

To start off, you should have to extract the TomatoCart ZIP file.Once extracted, you will have a {tomatocart-directory}containing the TomatoCart scripts. 

The contents of this {tomatocart-directory}needs to be moved to your webserver, either by copying the directory or by using an FTP progam.

You will then need to run the install script. To do this you need to open a browser and type in the URL.

If you are running on a your own computer, this will be

   http://localhost/{tomatocart-directory}/install/

or if on a live server:

   http://{www.mydomain.com}/install/


You then only need to follow the prompts and fill in blanks to install TomatoCart.
